### hey.

<!--
**ilylily/ilylily** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository
-->

i'm lily!

my pronouns are [she/her](https://pronoun.is/she) or [ze/hir](https://pronoun.is/ze)

i usually prefer to publish to [my gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ilylily/)

i like to port projects to my favourite operating system, openbsd; but i also have a strong interest in compatibility in general

i'm looking to collaborate on:
- platform compatibility (support for linux, bsd operating systems, and others)
- accessibility for disabled users, especially on open source platforms

i'm happy to help with just about anything! my favourite languages are c, rust, go, raku, and common lisp. i'm also quite good at javascript and python, but i have no great love for them. i know a fair few other languages, and i learn fast besides, so don't be afraid to say hi or get technical if your project isn't in one of those languages
